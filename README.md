by Eluwa Chisom

# Dataset:
The Data is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for the Global Burden of Disease Study. It contains data of 197 Countries between 1970 to 2010

# Summary of Findings

### In the exploration process, here are my discoveries:

- The total deaths from 1970 to 2010 globally were 237.2 million.
- The total deaths globally are classified as 54% male and 46% female.
- Overall, India has the highest number of deaths within this period (47.0million) and lowest is Marshall Island with 1.6k.
- The Age Group with the highest deaths during the period was 80+ and above with a total death of 37.7m globally.


# Key Insights for Presentation
- For my analysis, I focused on all variable of interest to understand their distribution: like age group, gender, countries, etc., 
- My goal was to discover how the numbers vary across these parameters. 
- I began by exploring aggregations like Sums, Averages, percentages using different plots to show trends and relationships.
- I explored them using piecharts, doughnut graph, barplot, line graph and maps for identifying any correlation between variables. 
- Clear titles, legends and different color palettes for each variable were used in the plots to ensure clarity of insights.
