by Eluwa Chisom

Dataset
The Data is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for the Global Burden of Disease Study. It contains data of 197 Countries between 1970 to 2010

Summary of Findings
In the exploration process, here are my discoveries:

The total deaths within 1970 to 2010 globally is 237.2 million.
The total deaths globally are classified as 54% male and 46% female.
Overrall, India has the highest deaths within this period (47.0million) and lowest is Marshall Island with (1.6k)
The Age Group with the highest deaths during the period is 89+ above with a total death of 37.7m globally


Key Insights for Presentation
For my analysis, I focus on all variable of interest to understand their distribution: like age group, gender, countries, etc., My goal is to discover how the numbers vary across these parameters . 
I begin by checking out aggregations like Sums, Averages, percentages using different plots to show trends and relationships. I explored them using piecharts, doughnut graph, barplot, line graph and maps for identifying any correlation between variables. 
Clear titles, legends and different color palettes for each variable were used in the plots to ensure clarity of insights.
